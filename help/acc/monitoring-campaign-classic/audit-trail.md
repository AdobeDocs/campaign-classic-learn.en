# How to use the Audit Trail

[!UICONTROL Audit Trail] captures, in real-time, a comprehensive list of actions and events occurring within Adobe Campaign. The [!UICONTROL Audit Trail] features includes a self-serve way to access a history of data to help answer questions such as:

* What happened to an object?
* Who modified it  last and when?
* What was the previous state?

>[!NOTE]

>Audit Trails requires Campaign Classic version 19.1 or newer

The [!UICONTROL Audit Trail] will log and list operator actions, such as creation, modification, and deletion for workflows, options, and source schema. In addition the following actions are logged specifically for workflows:

* Start
* Pause
* Stop
* Restart
* Cleanup
* Simulate
* Wakeup
* Unconditional Stop
