# Adding SSL Certificates

Adobe Campaign Control Panel allows you to add SSL certificates to secure your subdomains.

## Accessing Control Panel Subdomain Management

To access the Subdomain Management in Control Panel, go to:

* [Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/#/home) > Solution picker: Campaign > **Control Panel** card > **Subdomains & Certificates** card
  
  or
* Directly from the URL: [https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain](https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain)

## Steps to add SSL certificates

Adding SSL certificates requires three steps:

### 1. Generate Certificate Signing Requests

The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is required for the purchase of a SSL certificate. I needs to be generated for the instance and the subdomains you are planning to secure.

 The video below describes how to generate a Certificate Signing Request in Control Panel.

### 2. Purchase SSL Certificate

After obtaining the CSR, you will need to purchase the SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority approved by your organization.

### 3. Install SSL Certificates

Once you have obtained the SSL certificate it will need to be installed for the subdomains you are planning on securing.
