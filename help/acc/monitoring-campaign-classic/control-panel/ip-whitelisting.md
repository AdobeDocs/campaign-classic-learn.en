# IP Whitelisting for Instance Access

The Control Panel allows you to set up new connections to your instances by whitelisting IP address ranges. By default, an Adobe Campaign Classic instance is not accessible from various IP addresses. Therefore, an IP address needs to be whitelisted:

* To allow access to the Campaign instance from this IP address
* To connect an API to your Message Center or marketing instance

## Accessing Control Panel Instance Settings

To access the Subdomain Management in Control Panel, go to:

* [Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/#/home) > Solution picker: Campaign > **Control Panel** card > **Instances Settings** card
  
  or
* Directly from the URL: [https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/instances](https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/instances)

## How to whitelist IP addresses
