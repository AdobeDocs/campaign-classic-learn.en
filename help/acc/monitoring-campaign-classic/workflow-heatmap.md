# Workflow Heatmap

The Adobe Campaign Workflow HeatMap consists in a color-coded graphical representation of all the workflows that are currently running.  By providing a quick overview on the number of concurrent workflows, it enables the Adobe Campaign platform administrators to monitor the load on the instance and plan workflows accordingly.

The Workflow HeatMap helps the platform administrators to:

* See and understand concurrent workflows
* Filter workflows by duration to see which workflows may encounter issues
* Easily find individual workflows and all related activities (with their duration)

* Search by workflow type ([technical workflows](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/WKF__General_operation_Building_a_workflow.html#Technical_workflows) or [campaign workflows](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/WKF__General_operation_Building_a_workflow.html#Campaign_workflows))

* Look for a specific workflow to analyze

Please note: This feature is only available as of Adobe Campaign Classic V7 (build 18.11.1)
