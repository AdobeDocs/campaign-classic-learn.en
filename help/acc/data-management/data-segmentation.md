# Data Segmentation

 Adobe Campaign allows you to do advanced segmentation through deep queries of the common consumer attributes and other data sources allowing you to create reusable lists, dynamically updating lists based on real-time changes to data, and even do more complex activities such as multi-variate testing on any of those data points. This tutorial explains the integrated customer profile, how to create and update the profiles and how to create customer segments based on these profiles. 

## Integrated Customer Profile {#integrated-customer-profile}

Customers are generating data with every channel at their finger tips as they do all things that people do when trying to make a purchasing decision or simply interacting with your brand.

Adobe Campaign’s integrated customer profile enables marketers to both capture and manage that data at a grand scale; everything from profile attributes like demographic details “zip code” “address” “gender” etc, to interaction data, “opening of a message”, “click on an email”, “website visit”, into conversion data and even offline data.

## Customer Segmentation  {#customer-segmentation}

Once you have understood the profiles, you are ready to do advanced segmentation through deep queries of the common consumer attributes and other data sources. Allowing you to create reusable lists, dynamically updating lists based on real-time changes to data, and even do more complex activities such as multi-variate testing on any of those data points.

Please note: This video was recorded in Adobe Campaign Classic V6, the functionality is exactly the same, however the workflow icons have changed.
