# Defining Interactive Email Content with AMP

AMP for Email is a new open source format that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive emails. With modern app functionality directly available within emails, recipients can interact dynamically with content in the message itself.

Currently it is supported by two email providers: Gmail and Outlook.

>[!NOTE]
>
> To be able to deliver AMP emails you will need to register the email address you are sending from with [Google](https://developers.google.com/gmail/ampemail/register) and [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/amphtml/register-outlook).

The video below explains how to activate AMP in Adobe Campaign Classic and showcases the usage.
