# How to set up recurring and continuous email campaigns

This tutorial explains how to set up a recurring and a continuous delivery and the differences between the two approaches.  

## Recurring and Continuous Delivery Tracking {#recurring-and-continuous-delivery-tracking}

The recurring and continuous deliveries differ in the way contact data is managed:

* The **continuous delivery** lets you add new recipients to an existing delivery and avoids you having to create a new delivery each time a new recipient is added. You can update the creative directly in the campaign workflow and it will update the template in the delivery template Resource folder.  
  
  A continuous delivery will create a SINGLE delivery and delivery logs (broadLog) and tracking logs that reference that one delivery are added each time it executes.

* A **recurring delivery** will create a new delivery instance each time it executes. For example, if the workflow is scheduled to run once a week, that would result in 52 Deliveries after one year. This also means that the broad log and tracking logs will be separated by each delivery instance.
