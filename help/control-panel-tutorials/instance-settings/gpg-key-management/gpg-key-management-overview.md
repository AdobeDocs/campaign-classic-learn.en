# GPG key management - Overview

GPG (GnuPG) encrypts messages using asymmetric individual key pairs. To implement GPG encryption with [!DNL Campaign], GPG keys must be installed and/or generated on a marketing instance by an Administrator user directly from the Control Panel.

The following videos explain how to generate and install a public/private key pair on a specified [!DNL Campaign] instance for the encryption of outbound data, as well as import and install a public key on a [!DNL Campaign] instance for the decryption of inbound data.
