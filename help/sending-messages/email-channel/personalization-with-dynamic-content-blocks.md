# Personalizing emails using dynamic content blocks

In Adobe Campaign, you can personalize content or the appearance of messages and combine them with criteria from recipient profiles.

A personalization block is dynamic, personalized, and contains specific rendering code that can be added to deliveries. For example, you can add images, email headers, email footers, mirror page links, unsubscription links, and much more.

Learn how created dynamic content blocks and how to use them to personalize the content of your email delivery.
