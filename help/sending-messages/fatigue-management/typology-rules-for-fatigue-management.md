# How to set up fatigue management using typology rules

Fatigue management controls frequency and quantity of messaging to avoid over-solicitation of recipients and is often applied using a typology rule.

Typology rules allow marketers to standardize business practices across all deliveries more efficiently to control campaign messaging to customers. They do this by eliminating the need to apply exclusions or commonly used rules to each individual campaign. Recipients that match criteria within a *typology rule* will be excluded from the delivery during the analysis phase.

Usually a set of *typology rules* are grouped together within a *typology* in order to easily apply multiple filtering rules to a delivery at once.

This eliminates extra steps when creating different campaigns and workflows, all while ensuring that you are consistently targeting the right population at the right time.

This video explains how to implement fatigue management in Adobe Campaign Classic by leveraging typology rules.
