# How to set up fatigue management using typology rules

Fatigue management controls frequency and quantity of messaging to avoid over-solicitation of recipients and is often applied using a typology rule.

Typology rules allow marketers to standardize business practices across all deliveries more efficiently to control campaign messaging to customers. They do this by eliminating the need to apply exclusions or commonly used rules to each individual campaign. Recipients who match criteria within a *typology rule* are excluded from the delivery during the analysis phase.

This video explains how to implement fatigue management in Adobe Campaign Classic by applying typology rules.
